3D-Printable Optical Components
-------------------------------

## Mission Statement

The objective of this project is to produce a free library of optical components that can be manufactured by users through 3D printing or milling. 

The current scope of the project encompasses a cage system, a post system and various mounts. It does not include hard-to-manufacutre components such as lenses, mirrors and filters

## Disclaimer

This project is not ready for use. Do not attempt to manufacture any of the components.

## Manufacturing Requirements

### Equipment

- FDM or SLA 3D printers
- A hand saw and vice (for cutting cage poles to size)

### Software

- FreeCAD (only if viewing or modifying components)
- A 3D slicer compatible with your 3D printer

### Materials

FDM filament or SLA resin depending on the chosen manufacturing technique.

### Other Parts

- M4 and M6 thread inserts (see BOM)
- M4 thumbscrews 
- M5 grub screws
- M1.6 nylon-tipped grub screws
- Ø6mm aluminium rods (for use in cage system)

## Implemented Modules

### Main Groups:

- 30mm cage system
- Post and pedestal system
- Various compatible optical mounts

# Assembly

## Screws

All threads larger than M3 require corresponding thread inserts. These can be pressed to FMD printed components by heating them with a soldering iron. For the M1.6 grub screws used to clamp removable parts in place, threads must be tapped manually. It is recommended to use nylon-tipped set screws to avoid damaging clamped equipment.
