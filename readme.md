3D-Printable Optical Components
-------------------------------

## Mission Statement

The objective of this project is to produce a free library of optical components that can be manufactured by users through 3D printing or milling. 

The current scope of the project encompasses a cage system, a post system and various mounts. It does not include hard-to-manufacutre components such as lenses, mirrors and filters

## Disclaimer

This project is not ready for use. Do not attempt to manufacture any of the components.

## Manufacturing Requirements

### Equipment



### Software

- FreeCAD (only if viewing or modifying components)
- A 3D slicer for preparing SLA files for printing

### Other Parts

- Tap inserts (TODO: standardise tappings on all models)
- M3 or equivalent thumbscrews 
- M1 or equivalent set screws
- Ø6mm aluminium rods (for use in cage system)

### Main Groups:

- 30mm cage system
- Post and pedestal system
- Various compatible optical mounts

## All Modules

### Cage System

Ø30mm centre hole:

- Corner junction and mirror clamp
- Cross junction
- Side mount
- Poles (50mm, 100mm, 200mm)
- Full pole tie
- Half post tie

# Assembly

The use of M1.6 grub screws and corresponding thread inserts is assumed where it is necessary to clamp components in place. It is recommended to use nylon-tipped set screws to avoid damaging clamped equipment.
